### Charlie Blast's Territory - N64 Level Codes

Recently, my kids started playing "Charlie Blast's Territory" on the Nintendo 64.

After each complete level a set of cards is show with which the next level can
be unlocked.

Instead of having to keep writing down these level codes, I looked them up online
so the entire list is available to them.

[The level codes are available in a visual format, for easier use.](./Charlie-Blasts-Territory)
