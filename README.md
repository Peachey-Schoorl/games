# Games

This project contains things related to the board and video games we (as a family) play.

## Available games


## Level Codes

Some of the computer games that my kids play have a code to enter a specific level. 

Instead of having to keep writing down these level codes, I looked them up online
so the entire list is available to them here.

### Charlie Blast's Territory - N64 Level Codes

After each complete level a set of cards is show with which the next level can
be unlocked.
